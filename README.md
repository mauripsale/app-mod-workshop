# Workshop: Application Modernization in GCP
Codebase for the workshop "Application Modernization in GCP"

This basic code will be used as base project for a workshop. *Important*: this is NSFW (Not Suitable For Work) and it should not be used as example in a production environment. The code might contain security issues and is not optimized for a Cloud environment. It is based on PHP5 and MySQL.


# Database initialization
You can initialize the database using the scripts in `/db`. `01_schema.sql` will create the database schema, `02_seed.sql` will populate the database with example data. It will insert 3 users:
* an Admin user, with `admin` as username and `admin123` as password;
* a normal User, with `user1` as username and `user123` as password;
* an other normal User, with `user2` as username and `user123` as password.
The database will also be populated with some images, which are already delivered with the application.

# Basic configuration
To configure the project:
* update `config.php` to reflect the parameters that will be used to connect to the MySQL db;
* make `/uploads` directory writable.
